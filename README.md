# QR Code Generator in Python

This Python script allows you to generate QR codes from any given data (such as a URL, text, or any string). The QR code is saved as an image file (default is `qrcode.png`, but you can specify any filename).

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the `qrcode` Python library. You can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```
This will install both qrcode and the necessary Pillow library to handle image generation
